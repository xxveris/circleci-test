Hi Joe,

Michelly with CircleCI here. Thanks for reaching out.

You might need to use the path-filtering orb. Please follow the following steps.

1. Enable the Setup Workflows setting it to true (Project Settings -> Advanced -> At the bottom)
2. After signing up to the preview, navigate to the project settings page on CircleCI and enable the "Run Setup Workflows" setting.
3. Move your existing config to .circleci/continue_config.yml. Create workflows for each project and for the common shared folder.
4. On the .circleci/config.yml, add the setup-workflow
   Check here (https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/blob/path-filtering/docs/path-filtering.md) how to set it correctly 
5. Make sure to match the paths and parameters in the mapping to your project.
6. Finally, commit/push this branch.
