Hi Joe,

Michelly with CircleCI here. Thanks for reaching out.

You might need to use the path-filtering orb. Please follow the following steps.

Enable the Setup Workflows setting it to true (Project Settings -> Advanced -> At the bottom)
After signing up to the preview, navigate to the project settings page on CircleCI and enable the "Run Setup Workflows" setting.
Move your existing config to .circleci/continue_config.yml. Create workflows for each project and for the common shared folder.
On the .circleci/config.yml, add the setup-workflow
Check here how to set it correctly 
Make sure to match the paths and parameters in the mapping to your project.
Finally, commit/push this branch.
